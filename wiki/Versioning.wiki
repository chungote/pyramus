#summary Pyramus vesioning explained

= Pyramus version =

Pyramus's version is compound of date number and build number separated by dots (DATE.BUILD).

This is a real version number of Pyramus but there is also a "human readable" version of version number. This number does not have any real meaning but it exists because it's easier to remember than the real version number.   

For example Pyramus's version could be 1.2 (100920.28), which means that it was build at 10th of September and was 28th build of Pyramus. 

Besides normal Pyramus version there is a database version. Database version consists from build number and sequence number that is reset after every build.
