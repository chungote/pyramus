#summary Usage of PyramusUpdater

= Introduction =

PyramusUpdater is a tool for updating database from version to another.

= Installation =

Download a precompiled version of PyramusUpdater from http://code.google.com/p/pyramus/downloads/ and extract the package somewhere in your hard drive.

Extracted folder will contain a preference.properties file which contains settings for the program.

In that file you need to specify Pyramus updates directory (usually under updates folder inside Pyramus installation directory) and optionally you can specify default database connection settings.  

After that you need to copy jdbc driver inside pyramusupdater_lib folder. For example if you are using MySQL just download connector package from http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ and extract mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx-bin.jar from the archive and copy it under pyramusupdater_lib folder.

= Usage =

You can run PyramusUpdater simply by double clicking the pyramusupdater jar file but if that somehow fails you can run the program from terminal with command: `java -jar pyramusupdater.jar`

note that you need to have java installed into your computer.
